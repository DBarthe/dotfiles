# dotfiles

Support only bash configuration.

## Quick start

```bash
$ cd ~
$ git clone git@github.com:DBarthe/dotfiles.git
$ cd dotfiles
$ ./install.sh
```

Then reload your shell:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Understand

`~/.bashrc` symlinks to `~/dotfiles/bash/bashrc`. Any program that appends content to `.bashrc` will in fact writes at the end of `~/dotfiles/bash/bashrc`. This file is generated by `./install.sh`, and ignored from the git repository.

`~/dotfiles/bash/bashrc` sources `~/dotfiles/bash/entry.in.sh`

`~/dotfiles/bash/entry.in.sh` sources a list of modules according to the variable `include_order`:

```bash
include_order=$(cat <<EOF
  base.in.sh
  common.in.sh
  prompt.in.sh
  ssh-agent.in.sh
  emacs-cleaner.in.sh
EOF
)
```

Any modification in `entry.in.sh` and sub-modules takes effect immediately, without need to run `./install.sh` again.

## Features

Refer to the source code itself.

## Adding a new feature

1. Create a file `bash/new-feature.in.sh`
2. Code what you need in it
3. In `bash/entry.in.sh`, add your filename in the `include_order` list
